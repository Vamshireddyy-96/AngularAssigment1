    For many years man has been living on earth. But there are only a few people who live their 
    entire life for others. They live to ease the sufferings of others. The purpose of their life 
    is toreduce their pain and sorrows and spread happiness.
   MotherTeresa was one of the few. She had lived her whole life for the welfare of others.
    She became the support of the poor, sick, and helpless people. She will be the GlobalIcon forever.
    
    Let's see her life journey of compassion and humanity. Also, don't miss 
    the facts about Mother Teresa in the end:

    After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes
     for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes,
      as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[7]

Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace
 Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. She was praised and criticised on various counts, such as for her views on abortion and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorized biography was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of other books as well as films.
