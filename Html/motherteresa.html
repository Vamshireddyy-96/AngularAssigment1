        Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Little is
         known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor. At the age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto, she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux – the patron saint of missionaries.

        On her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after. Mother Teresa felt that serving others was a fundamental principle of the teachings of Jesus Christ. She often mentioned the saying of Jesus,
        
        “Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it to me.”
        
        As Mother Teresa said herself:
        
        “Love cannot remain by itself – it has no meaning. Love has to be put into action, and that 
        action is service .” – Mother Teresa
        
        mother-teresaShe experienced two particularly traumatic periods in Calcutta. The first was
         the Bengal famine of 1943 and the second was the Hindu/Muslim violence in 1946, before the
          partition of India. In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time among the poorest of Calcutta.
           She chose to wear a white Indian sari, with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional Indian dress.
            For many years, Mother Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns survived on minimal income and food, 
            often having to beg for funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were noted and appreciated by the local community and Indian politicians.
        
        In 1952, she opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people to die with dignity.
         Mother Teresa often spent time with those who were dying. Some have criticised the lack of 
         proper medical attention, and their refusal to give painkillers. Others say that it afforded 
         many neglected people the opportunity to die knowing that someone cared.
        
        Her work spread around the world. By 2013, there were 700 missions operating in over 130 countries. 
        The scope of their work also expanded to include orphanages and hospices for those with terminal illnesses.
